# Sprint 2

## What was good

-   **Improved Testing Practices:** The team successfully addressed the previous lack of integration testing, enhancing overall testing procedures. Unit tests for domain classes were implemented, aligning with the client's requirements and workflow.

-   **Adherence to Definitions of Ready and Done:** Rigorous adherence to Definitions of Ready (DoR) and Done (DoD) improved the standardization of the development process, reducing ambiguity and enhancing efficiency.

-   **Effective Communication:** Building upon Sprint 1, the team continued to excel in communication. The introduction of more frequent code reviews and daily scrum meetings at 17h (excluding Fridays at 18h) contributed to better team coordination.

## What was not good

-   **Testing Coverage:** While there was an improvement in testing practices, not all user stories were thoroughly tested. The team acknowledges the need for continuous improvement in testing coverage.

## Ideas

-   **Testing Enhancement:**

    -   Continue code refactoring and address incomplete tests from the previous sprint.
    -   Ensure thorough testing for every user story during Sprint 3 development.
    -   Regularly review and update tests to reflect client requirements and workflow.

-   **Early Task Initiation:**
    -   Strive for earlier task initiation to provide ample time for comprehensive testing and issue resolution.
    -   Monitor and evaluate the impact of early task initiation on overall sprint progress.

## What will be done

1. **Testing Enhancement:**

    - Refactor code and address incomplete tests from the previous sprint.
    - Ensure thorough testing for every user story during development.
    - Conduct regular reviews of test coverage and update tests to align with client requirements.

2. **Early Task Initiation:**

    - Aim to initiate tasks earlier in the sprint to allow for comprehensive testing and issue resolution.
    - Monitor the impact of early task initiation on overall sprint progress and adjust as needed.

3. **Continuous Improvement:**

    - Maintain emphasis on code testing and consider industry best practices for testing in agile development.
    - Encourage open discussions during retrospectives to identify further areas for improvement.

4. **Communication and Meetings:**
    - Continue with daily scrum meetings at 17h, excluding Fridays (which will be held at 18h).
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of the meeting schedule for team coordination.
    - Monitor the impact of more frequent code reviews on code quality and overall collaboration.
