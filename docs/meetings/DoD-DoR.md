# Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready (DoR) outlines the criteria that a user story must meet before it's ready to be taken up by the team for implementation.
Our DoR include aspects such as:

- **Clear and Detailed Description:** The user story should have a clear and comprehensive description, outlining the feature or functionality required.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** Well-defined acceptance criteria need to be established, providing a set of conditions that, when met, will indicate
that the story is completed satisfactorily.

- **Dependencies and Resources:** Any prerequisites, dependencies, or resources needed for the story should be identified and available before commencing work.

- **Estimation and Sizing:** The story should be appropriately estimated and sized, allowing the team to understand the effort and time required for its completion.

- **Review and Approval:** The work should undergo a review process and receive approval from the relevant stakeholders or team members before being considered ready.

# Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done (DoD) represents the criteria that must be fulfilled for a user story to be considered complete and ready for deployment.
It acts as a checklist to guarantee that the team has met the necessary quality standards before considering the story as finished.
Our DoD includes:

- **Code Quality:** If applicable, the code written should adhere to coding standards, be maintainable, and free from critical issues.

- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing needs to be performed, covering unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant testing as specified in the DoR.

- **Documentation:** Any necessary documentation, such as technical documentation or user guides, should be completed.

- **Review and Approval:** The work should undergo a review process and receive approval from the relevant stakeholders or team members before being considered done.

Utilizing both the Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) ensures that the team starts working on well-prepared user stories and finishes
them to a consistent and satisfactory standard, maintaining quality and alignment with the project's requirements and expectations.
