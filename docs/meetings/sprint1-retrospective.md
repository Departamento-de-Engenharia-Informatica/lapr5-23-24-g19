# Sprint 1

After analysing our work throughout sprint 1, we came to the conclusion that we did a great effort on assigning the required tasks between each other and every
member had approximately the same amount of work load. Despite successfully implementing all user stories, the team recognized a significant weakness
in our code testing procedures. Specifically, we identified a lack of integration testing, with unit tests primarily concentrating on domain classes.
During this meeting we also discussed the definitions of DoR (definiton of ready) and DoD (definition of done).

## What was good

- Great communication
- All users stories were successfully implemented
- Tasks were distributed evenly

## What was not good

- We started working close to the end of the sprint (about one week before)
- Not all user stories were tested

## Ideas

- We will start by refactoring the previous code and implement the tests that were left incomplete
- Enhanced emphasis on code testing
- Conduct more frequent code reviews and daily scrum meetings everyday at 17h (besides on fridays which will occur at 18h)

## What will be done

- We will enhance our emphasis on code testing
    + Some use cases from the previous sprint will have their tests modified to better reflect the client's requirements and workflow
    + Every sprint 2 user story must be tested as it's being developed
- Conduct more frequent code reviews and daily scrum meetings everyday at 17h (besides on fridays which will occur at 18h)
