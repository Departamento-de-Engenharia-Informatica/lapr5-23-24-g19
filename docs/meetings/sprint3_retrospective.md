# Sprint 3

## What was good

-   **Improved Testing Practices:** The team kept up with the good practices development throughout the previous sprint regarding user story testing.

-   **Adherence to Definitions of Ready and Done:** Rigorous adherence to Definitions of Ready (DoR) and Done (DoD) improved the standardization of the development process, reducing ambiguity and enhancing efficiency.

-   **Effective Communication:** Building upon Sprint 2, the team continued to excel in communication. The introduction of more frequent code reviews and weekly scrum meetings at every Monday contributed to better team coordination.

-   **Testing Coverage:** Testing Coverage suffered an improvement from last sprint, impulsed by a more rigourous DoR and DoD practices.

## What was not good

-   **Testing Coverage:** While there was an improvement in testing practices, not all user stories were thoroughly tested. The team acknowledges the need for continuous improvement in testing coverage.

## Ideas

-   **Testing Enhancement:**

    -   Continue code refactoring and address incomplete tests from the previous sprint.
    -   Regularly review and update tests to reflect client's requirements and desired workflow.

-   **Early Task Initiation:**
    -   Strive for earlier task initiation to provide ample time for comprehensive testing and issue resolution.
    -   Monitor and evaluate the impact of early task initiation on overall sprint progress.

## What will be done

In the case of a new Sprint, the following should be considered:

1. **Testing Enhancement:**

    - Refactor code and address incomplete tests from the previous sprint.
    - Ensure thorough testing for every user story during development.
    - Conduct regular reviews of test coverage and update tests to align with client requirements.

2. **Early Task Initiation:**

    - Aim to initiate tasks earlier in the sprint to allow for comprehensive testing and issue resolution.
    - Monitor the impact of early task initiation on overall sprint progress and adjust as needed.

3. **Continuous Improvement:**

    - Maintain emphasis on code testing and consider industry best practices for testing in agile development.
    - Encourage open discussions during retrospectives to identify further areas for improvement.

4. **Communication and Meetings:**
    - Start following daily meeting practices.
    - Monitor the impact of more frequent code reviews on code quality and overall collaboration.
