> As a campus manager, I intend to create a building.

The building creation and persistence processes were already
documented and implemented as per [us150](../us150/README.md).

Thus, this specific use case is solely concerned with the
development of a user interface (UI) that the campus
manager can utilize.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

To successfully complete this user story, the following criteria must be met:

<!-- - The interface should be able to display/communicate to the -->
<!-- user what buildings already exist in the system. -->
<!--     + This list should be updated after a successful creation -->
- When the user provides valid data, the building should
be successfully created (assuming no internal errors in the application backend)
    + Similarly, if invalid data is provided, the user should
    be informed of what went wrong

## 5. Dependencies

This user story depends upon the following use cases:

1. US 150, building creation via the campus API.

## 6. Design Patterns
- Dependency inversion: Classes of one layer don't use specific implementations of a class from another layer (aside from domain); instead an interface defines a contract for how communications are made.

- Dependency injection: Since no explicit implementations are used, an injection mechanism takes care of deciding, at runtime, which implementation to use based on a configuration file.

- Single Responsibility (partially) - for each domain entity, there is a dedicated controller, service, repository (interface) definition that deals with/processes/handles operations related to that domain entity, and no other.
    + The reason it is a partial use lies in the fact that each controller/service could be broken down by use case rather than by entity

- DTO: DTO's are used to transfer information between the different layers
