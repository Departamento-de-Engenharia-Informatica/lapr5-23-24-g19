## 1. User Story Description

This user story addresses the needs of the Fleet Manager role, providing them with the capability to add robot types to a fleet.

## 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

The customer has specified that the Fleet Manager should be able to create a robot type, specifying its brand, code, model, and associated task types.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria and Tests

To successfully complete this user story, the following criteria must be met:

- The system should display already existing robot types before the creation process.
- The displayed robot types should be updated every time the user creates a new one.
- The user should be prevented from submitting the form if any of the values do not conform to the required types.

## 5. Dependencies

This user story relies on one API functionality:

- [US350](../us350)
    + Used to POST the newly created robot type
    ```
    POST /robottypes
    ```

## 5. Design Patterns
- Dependency inversion: Classes of one layer don't use specific implementations of a class from another layer (aside from domain); instead an interface defines a contract for how communications are made.

- Dependency injection: Since no explicit implementations are used, an injection mechanism takes care of deciding, at runtime, which implementation to use based on a configuration file.

- Single Responsibility (partially) - for each domain entity, there is a dedicated controller, service, repository (interface) definition that deals with/processes/handles operations related to that domain entity, and no other.
    + The reason it is a partial use lies in the fact that each controller/service could be broken down by use case rather than by entity

- DTO: DTO's are used to transfer information between the different layers
