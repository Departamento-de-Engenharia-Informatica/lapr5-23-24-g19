## 1. User Story Description

This user story focuses on the functionality of listing floors associated with a specified building.

## 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

## 4. Acceptance Criteria and Tests

To successfully complete this user story, the following criteria must be met:

- The user interface must adeptly present the floors, along with their respective specifications and details.

## 5. Dependencies

This user story relies on [US170](../us180), which provides the GET route for buildings in the backend API:

```
GET /buildings
```

Additionally, this user story depends on [US210](../us210), responsible for exposing the GET route for floors from a specific building:

```
GET /buildings/{id}/floors
```

## 5. Design Patterns
- Dependency inversion: Classes of one layer don't use specific implementations of a class from another layer (aside from domain); instead an interface defines a contract for how communications are made.

- Dependency injection: Since no explicit implementations are used, an injection mechanism takes care of deciding, at runtime, which implementation to use based on a configuration file.

- Single Responsibility (partially) - for each domain entity, there is a dedicated controller, service, repository (interface) definition that deals with/processes/handles operations related to that domain entity, and no other.
    + The reason it is a partial use lies in the fact that each controller/service could be broken down by use case rather than by entity

- DTO: DTO's are used to transfer information between the different layers
