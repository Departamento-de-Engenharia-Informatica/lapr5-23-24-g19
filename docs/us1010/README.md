## 1. User Story Description

This user story addresses the needs of the Fleet Manager role, providing them with the capability to create robots, upon the selection of a robot type.

## 2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

The customer has specified that the Fleet Manager should be able to create a robot, specifying its type, code, nickname, serialNumber, and an optional description.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria and Tests

To successfully complete this user story, the following criteria must be met:

- The user interface should present available robot types and prompt the user to select the desired robot type to create a robot.
- After selecting the robot type, the user interface should display the existing robots within that type.
- The displayed robots should be updated every time the user changes the desired robot type.
- The displayed robots should be updated every time the user creates a new one.
- The user should be prevented from submitting the form if any of the values do not conform to the required types.

## 5. Dependencies

This user story relies on two API functionalities:

- [list-robotTypes](../list-robotTypes)
    + Used to GET existing robot types
    ```
    GET /robottypes
    ```
- [US380](../us380)
    + Used to GET existing robots
    ```
    GET /robots
    ```
- [US360](../us350)
    + Used to POST the newly created robot
    ```
    POST /robots
    ```

## 5. Design Patterns
- Dependency inversion: Classes of one layer don't use specific implementations of a class from another layer (aside from domain); instead an interface defines a contract for how communications are made.

- Dependency injection: Since no explicit implementations are used, an injection mechanism takes care of deciding, at runtime, which implementation to use based on a configuration file.

- Single Responsibility (partially) - for each domain entity, there is a dedicated controller, service, repository (interface) definition that deals with/processes/handles operations related to that domain entity, and no other.
    + The reason it is a partial use lies in the fact that each controller/service could be broken down by use case rather than by entity

- DTO: DTO's are used to transfer information between the different layers
