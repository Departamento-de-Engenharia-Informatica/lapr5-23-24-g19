## Logical View - Level 2

------------------------------
The logical view (component diagram) aims to provide an overview of the system architecture's structure and organization.
This is level 2, which is a less abstract view than what we saw at level 1.
In the level above, at level 3, we will examine in detail the components of all system modules.
