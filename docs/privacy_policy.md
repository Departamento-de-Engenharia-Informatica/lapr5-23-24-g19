# Which personal data do we process and for which reasons?

In the realm of data collection, our primary focus centers on obtaining individual identification information. Adhering to the stipulations outlined in
Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is imperative to conduct lawful data processing. To ensure compliance, the purpose of
collection must be meticulously specified, providing explicit and informed details.

The data collection and processing unfold in two distinct phases: initially, during user registration, and subsequently, as individuals move within the premises,
facilitated by biometric means. The latter procedure is designed to enhance the robots' efficacy in executing surveillance and object delivery tasks.
This is achieved through the utilization of embedded cameras, empowering the robots to perform their functions seamlessly.

## Name

The name of the individual registered in the system is important to make it possible not only to build the person's profile,
but also to facilitate correspondence with them, whether by telephone or email.

## Institutional E-mail

Collecting the institutional email address is not only essential for effective communications between the organization and the data owner,
but also for the purpose of recovering the user's account in the system. This e-mail also serves the purpose to identify the user within the system.

## Phone Number

Crucial for effective communication, the telephone number takes on heightened significance within the realm of account security.
Moreover, it plays a dual role as a key point of contact for automated processes, facilitating tasks ranging from deliveries to surveillance.
Envisioning a potential system evolution encompassing authentication through correspondence and SMS confirmation,
the incorporation of this information becomes strategically imperative.

## VAT

We are obligated to request and process the VAT number of each individual in order to generate invoices for the services provided.

## Biometric Data derived from Video/Image

Biometric data derived from video image collection plays a pivotal role in the precise identification of individuals by robotic systems.
The utilization of video image capture not only facilitates the accurate targeting of deliveries to specific individuals but also enhances the
efficacy of surveillance in scenarios involving multiple individuals within buildings. It is essential to highlight that the collection of
biometric data aligns with Portuguese legislation, specifically in accordance with Article 19 of Law 58/2019.

## Role in the System

System Functions, including Campus Manager, Fleet Manager, and Task Manager, provide users with a tailored graphical interface,
streamlining access to essential functions corresponding to their specific tasks.

# How long do we store personal data?

Personal data is retained for the duration of an individual's association with the organization. However, two exceptions exist: VAT and Biometric Data.

In anticipation of potential legal proceedings, VAT-related data will be securely retained for a duration of five years.

Biometric Data acquired through surveillance methods is systematically erased after 30 days.
This timeframe is deemed essential to ensure the optimal functionality of the system, aligning with directives for the proper management of data.
This practice not only supports effective execution but also upholds the principles of data management.
